# Campus Connect

Campus Connect is a Python-based social networking application designed to help college students connect, collaborate, and communicate with peers in similar majors or courses.  
It combines **Graph** and **Tree** data structures with a modern **CustomTkinter GUI** to simulate campus-wide relationships and discussion threads.

---

## Project Overview
Campus Connect visualizes how students form academic and social connections on campus.  
Each student is represented as a **node** in a graph, while friendships and collaborations form the **edges** between them.  
Hierarchical discussions (like replies in chat threads) are managed using **tree structures**.

## Features
- **Student Graph Network** – Each student can connect to others with shared majors or interests.  
- **Tree-Based Discussion Threads** – Organize conversations hierarchically (reply chains).  
- **GUI Interface** – Built with `CustomTkinter` for a clean, modern look.  
- **Login System** – Secure entry point before accessing the main dashboard.  
- **Connection Suggestions** – Uses graph traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS) to suggest friends.
